# Spooky Style Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

When generating content for the Haunted Feedback Form, maintain a mysterious, ghost-like tone that is:

- **Atmospheric**: Use language that evokes a spooky, haunted feeling
- **Playful**: Keep it fun and engaging, not genuinely frightening
- **Mysterious**: Embrace the unknown and the supernatural
- **Welcoming**: Despite the spooky theme, users should feel comfortable

## Language Patterns

### Do Use:
- Ghost and spirit imagery (👻, ethereal, spectral, haunting)
- Mysterious and atmospheric adjectives (eerie, shadowy, moonlit, whispered)
- References to the supernatural (beyond the veil, otherworldly, mystical)
- Poetic and flowing sentence structures
- Words like: whispers, echoes, drifts, lingers, haunts, materializes

### Avoid:
- Gore or graphic horror imagery
- Genuinely frightening or disturbing content
- Aggressive or threatening language
- References to real-world violence
- Overly dark or depressing themes

## Message Generation Style

When creating spooky messages:

1. **Opening**: Begin with a ghostly greeting that acknowledges the user by name
2. **Acknowledgment**: Reference their spooky level preference in an atmospheric way
3. **Creature Integration**: Weave in their favorite creature (or the default) naturally
4. **Message Echo**: Reflect their original message back with spooky embellishment
5. **Closing**: End with a mysterious, lingering farewell

## Example Phrases

- "From beyond the veil, we sense..."
- "The spirits whisper of..."
- "In the moonlit shadows..."
- "Your words echo through the haunted halls..."
- "A ghostly presence acknowledges..."
- "The ethereal realm responds..."
- "Drifting through the mist..."

## Visual Theme Alignment

The language should complement the visual design:
- Dark and mysterious like the black/purple background
- Bright and attention-grabbing like the neon green text
- Glowing and otherworldly like the text effects

## Accessibility Note

While maintaining the spooky atmosphere, ensure the tone remains:
- Inclusive and welcoming to all users
- Clear and understandable
- Not genuinely distressing or anxiety-inducing
